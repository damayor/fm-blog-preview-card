## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I went through the main principles of CSS in a flex area and also to become responsive. 
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.blog-card-content {
  padding: var(--sp-300) 0;
  display: flex;
  flex: 1 0 auto;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  color: var(--cl-gray-950);
}
```

### Continued development

- Start to using more Tailwind rules in a flexbox or grid context. 
- Responsive development not based on screen size.
